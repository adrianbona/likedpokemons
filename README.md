### **Exercise Description**
This exercise consists of 3 practical parts and a final teorethical questions section.

For the completion of the practical parts, you are free to modify the existing repo in any way you see fit. You are also allowed to look things up online.

The desired system is a Pok√©mon (from the famous TV show) list with the ability to like and un-like Pok√©mon.

Pok√©mon should be fetched from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and stored in a useState hook. This Pok√©mon listing should contain options for liking each Pok√©mon.

### **What You Need to Do**

1. **Complete the Logic for `fetchPokemons`:**
    - Make a `GET` request to the endpoint `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=9`.
    - Map the fetched data to include the property `liked` initialized to `false` and get the `id` from the received pokemon `url`.
        - Eg. if the API call returns a Pok√©mon with url`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/8/`, the number `8` is the `id` of that Pok√©mon.
    - Update the `pokemons` state with the fetched data.

2. **Implement the `PokemonCard` component:**
    - Follow the designs in [design_mockup.png](./design_mockup.png)
    - The pokemon name is shown on top, followed by the picture. You can obtain the picture using the following url: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/${pokemonId}.png` where pokemonId is the id of the pokemon previously mapped
    - On the bottom, there should be a button that shows "‚ù§Ô∏è Liked" for Liked Pokemon and "ü§ç Like" otherwise. The button's functionality will be implemented on the next step.

3. **Complete the Logic for `toggleLike`:**
    - Toggle the `liked` state of the corresponding Pok√©mon.
    - Update the `likedPokemons` list to synchronize it with the Pok√©mon marked as "liked."
